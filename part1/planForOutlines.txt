1. Render the model at a little higher scale on a different, outline pass. Draw in outline color
2. Change the depth value of every fragment in this render to slightly farther away then it should be. This should put the
   outline behind the object model, even with the added scale
3. Done!

Alternatively, using this probably is a good first step

Post implementation notes:
* I used the openGL tutorial, not my original approach (even though it would have worked as well)
* Outline looks good, but might try to scale by normals instead of scale by model scale for the outline, as the outline is a little non-uniform
around the Chalice in current state (some parts of outline are larger than others)
